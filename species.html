    <h3>Here are some of the Marine Endangered Species in the Puget Sound:&nbsp;</h3>
    <h4>Mammals</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Blue Whale</strong> &ndash; Blue Whales are the largest animals to live on our planet. They have a lifespan of around 80-90 years, can weigh up to 165 tons and they have a length of up to 110 feet. The blue whale population was significantly depleted due to commercial whaling activities worldwide. Blue whales regularly appeared off the Washington coast prior to and during the whaling era. Sightings are quite rare now, with just three in the last 50 years, including six animals seen in December 2011. The total global population is estimated at only 5,000 whales.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Fin Whale&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; The fin whale is the second-largest species of whale. They are found throughout the world&rsquo;s oceans. Fin whales weigh from 40 to 80 tons, have a length of 75 to 85 feet, and have a lifespan of 80 to 90 years. Populations in the North Pacific are estimated to have once numbered 42,000 to 45,000 whales but were significantly reduced to an estimated 13,000 to 18,700 animals during the whaling era. Today, the fin whale&rsquo;s biggest threat is from vessel strikes, entanglement, and ocean noise.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Humpback Whale&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; The humpback whale encompasses the world&rsquo;s oceans from the tropics to higher latitudes. The humpback whale has a lifespan of about 80 to 90 years, can weigh up to 40 tons, and have a length of up to 60 feet. Humpback whales that feed along the U.S west coast belong to the California/Oregon/Washington stock, which is comprised of a Washington/southern British Columbia feeding group and a California/Oregon feeding group. The largest threats to humpback whales are entanglement in fishing gear, vessel strikes, and vessel-based harassment.</li>
        <li>
        <strong>Orca Whale</strong> &ndash; Orca whales, also known as killer whales, are the largest member of the oceanic dolphins. Orca&rsquo;s have a lifespan of 30 to 90 years, can weigh up to 11 tons, and have a length of up to 32 feet. Orca whale populations regularly occur in Washington. The southern resident population has shown an overall decline trend since 1995, falling from 98 to 81 whales in March 2015. The largest threats to orca whales are lack of food due to overfishing, ocean contaminants, oil spills, and disturbance from vessels and sound.&nbsp;
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Molluscs</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pinto Abalone</strong> &ndash; The pinto abalone is a species of large sea snail. The pinto abalone is an endangered species in the State of Washington. Abalone populations have been in decline worldwide due to over-harvest and habitat degradation.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
