       <h2>Issues & Problems in Puget Sound</h2>
    <h4><i>More than 60% of environmental issues the Puget Sound faces every day are caused by human activities based on scientific studies. The following concerns will provide the results of our effects.</i></h4>
  <p>- Acidification of the water is a global problem that has local effects. It is the change of seawater chemistry caused by an     increased amount of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel and deforestation. Carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere and is absorbed into the ocean.  The marine organisms, such as shellfish, planktons, and fish are impacted by weakening their strong shells and skeletons. This affects the ecosystem since shellfish is also food source for salmon, seabirds, whales, and other marine wildlife. 
    <br><br>
    - Bacteria pollution in the Puget Sound is from animal waste and human waste. This is a risk to human health when people swim in the water, as they could be exposed to illnesses. In addition, if bacteria levels are high, shellfish are not safe to eat. Most pathogenic bacteria come from faulty septic systems, discharge from boates, sewage overflows, contaminated stormwater, livestock waste, and more.

    - High levels of nitrogen influence the fall of oxygen levels, causing the marine life to suffocate. There are many parts of Puget Sound that have oxygen levels that are below the levels needed for marine life to thrive and persist for most of the year. Some causes for dissolved oxygen levels include quality and timing of water entering, circulation patterns, air and water temperature, and salinity. Having too much nitrogen fuels marine algae growth. When algae dies, oxygen is consumed.
    <br><br>
    - The release of toxic chemicals from everyday human sources pollutes the environment. Such products come from vehicles, flame retardants in furniture, plastic, and building and roofing material. As products are used and disposed of, the toxins can enter streams, rivers, lakes, and lead to the Puget Sound. These risk harm to not only the marine, but also animals and human health. Toxic chemicals impair the development and reproduction cycle of the marine. The toxins can linger in the environments for decades and found in the fatty tissue of people and animals long after their use has been stopped.

    <h2>What We Can Do To Help!</h2>
    <img src="images/water.jpeg" alt="image" height ="250" width="490">
    <p>Puget Sound faces many threats from everyday activities caused by the 4.5 million people who live here and around the nation’s marine. More than 60 percent of water pollution comes from oil and other fluids leaking from cars and trucks; fertilizers and pesticides from farms; runoff from lawns and gardens; and fuel spills from recreational boaters. You can help play a part in keeping Puget Sound clean and healthy.

<strong>Here are some ways you can help save the environment:</strong>
<br>
<br>
<u>Reduce Energy Consumption </u><br>
Be conscious of your energy use at home and work. Remember to turn off any lights that are not needed. You can also switch to compact fluorescent bulbs to help save energy. 
<br><br>
<u>Use Fewer Plastic Products</u><br>
Plastic products end up as ocean debris and are a major cause of habitat destruction.  To reduce your impact, carry a reusable water bottle, store food in nondisposable containers, use reusable shopping bags, and recycle.
<br>
<br>
<u>Properly Dispose of Hazardous Materials</u><br>
If you’re unsure of what is considered hazardous, contact the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). They will provide you the specific characteristics of what is hazardous. Most hazardous items are combustible and flammable materials, corrosive materials, reactive materials, and toxic materials.
<br> <br>
<u>Pick Up Garbage and Litter</u><br>
Most of the ocean debris comes from litter on the beach. Unfortunately, it’s common for people to leave behind their trash. If you visit the beach, bring a trash bag and pick up what gets left behind.
<br><br>
<u>Support Organizations</u><br>
There are many organizations fighting to protect marine and ocean wildlife. Consider giving financial support or volunteer for hands-on work or advocacy. The Puget Sound has many locals groups you could get involved in.
