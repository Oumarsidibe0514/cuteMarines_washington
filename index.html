    <h2> The Puget Sound is Home to a Vibrant Ecosystem and Species</h2>
    <p>Our purpose is to address the issues and problems the marine conservations are challenged with and what we can do to help. Many of the concerns include everyday human effects and endangered species. As a community, it’s our responsibility to be involved in the change for improvement and help save the Puget Sound Marine!

      There are many Marine Conservation Organizations that provides you with information for a better understanding of what damages the Puget Sound Marine and what we can do to fix it.

     <h2>What is Marine Conservation?</h2>
      
    <p>Marine conservation refers to the study of marine life such as animals and plants, animal resources, and ecosystem functions. Marine conservation focuses on the preservation and protection of ecosystems in oceans and other bodies of water through careful planning and management in order to prevent the exploitation of resources. Some of the main focuses in marine conservation is limiting and preventing human-caused damage to marine ecosystems, preserving vulnerable species, and restoring damaged marine ecosystems.</p>

    <h2>Why is Marine Conservation Important?&nbsp;</h2>

    <p>Marine conservations are important because their main focuses are to protect and preserve our oceans and the marine life that lives in them. Our oceans have been negatively affected over the past few years due to a range of problems such as climate change, pollution, overfishing, acidification, and eutrophication (the ecosystem&rsquo;s reaction to artificial substances such as sewage, fertilizers, and detergents).&nbsp;</p>

    <p>You may ask yourself, &ldquo;Why should I care about the ocean?&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;Here are some reasons:</p>
  
  <ul>
      <li> <strong>Air. </strong>70% of oxygen the atmosphere is <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/activity/save-the-plankton-breathe-freely/">produced by marine plants.</a></li>
      <br>

      <li><strong>Jobs. </strong>Fishing, fisheries, and aquaculture supports the livelihoods and families of about 880 million people, that is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fao.org/zhc/detail-events/en/c/846698/">12% of the world&rsquo;s population. </a></li>
      <br>

      <li><strong>Climate regulation.</strong>The oceans covers 70% of the Earth&rsquo;s surface and transports heat from the equator to the poles,  <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/mpaloc.html">regulating our climate and weather patterns.</a></li>
      <br>

      <li><strong>Medicine.</strong> Many medicinal products come from our oceans. Scientists have discovered ingredients with properties that help fight cancer, Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, arthritis, and heart disease. Horseshoe crabs, seaweeds, and some marine bacteria are some examples of the <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/why-care-about-ocean.html">marine life that have medical properties.</a></li>
      <br>

      <li><strong>Food.</strong> Ocean&rsquo;s are an important source for food. Fish provide 20% of animal protein to about 3 billion people.Ingredients from the sea are also essential to other surprising foods such as <a href="http://www.fao.org/zhc/detail-events/en/c/846698/">soy milk and peanut butter.</a></li>

  </ul>
